            <p>Sass is really just a way to write CSS. You can certainly learn both at the same time, if you write in the SCSS
                format,
                but learning CSS is about learning how to style, layout and animate your content, learning Sass is about doing it
                efficiently on the production side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning Sass won't do you any good if you don't know how a float or a z-index works.
                ...
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing CSS means you know how to do the things you've learned, like media queries, animations and transitions as
                well
                as things you'll need to know in the future, like flex-box and CSS grid. It also means knowing how to fix common
                problems and have a good grip on browser support. And many other style-related issues like how to set your
                typography
                and color schemes consistently.

            <p>Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on your project. If you want to just browse here, go ahead, but we
            recommend you go install Sass first</p>

            <p>Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions,
            and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to
            share design within and across projects..</p>
